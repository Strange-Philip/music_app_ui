# Music App UI Design with Flutter

🎨A flutter ui project inspired by this Ui design by the work of [Jeffery]() x [Raegan]().

🔗Here is a link to the 👉🏾[original design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8MTbPs6ZXUSsduaPdBLWNY/Community-File?type=design&node-id=3%3A298&mode=design&t=Nar1sMWWQ7duGomy-1p) .

## 🧪Additions I made to the design:
Added some animations to the project to make it more interesting.🫣


Feel free to clone the project and play around with it.I tried to organize the code as much as possible.
